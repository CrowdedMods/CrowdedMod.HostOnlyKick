# CrowdedMod.HostOnlyKick
This mod changes vote-kicking feature in Among Us to only allow lobby host to kick players. </br>
It was originally created to prevent targetting in big player lobbies, as an extension to [CrowdedMod](https://github.com/CrowdedMods/CrowdedMod), but
it can be used independently.
